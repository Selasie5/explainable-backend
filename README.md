# Explainable AI Backend Engine 🧠

This project provides an API for generating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations to interpret and explain machine learning model predictions. It is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and reproducibility.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Accepts structured input data and returns SHAP explanations
- 📊 Supports both text and image models (with potential extension to others)
- 🐳 Dockerized for scalable and environment-agnostic deployment
- 📁 Saves plots to disk and serves results via API
- 🧪 Extensible: plug in your own models
